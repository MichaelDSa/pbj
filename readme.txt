/// pbj.py README ///
pbj.py is a bookmarking script for your directories. 
directories are saved to keys in json format in the config
file like so:
{
   "category1": {
      "key1": "path/to/value1",
      "key2": "path/to/value2"
   },
   "category2": {
      "key1": "path/to/value1",
      "key2": "path/tp/value2"
   }
}

The intention of having categories is for cross platform and
cross device availability. For example, categories can be
'desktop', 'laptop', 'linux', 'mac', etc. The first category
is the default category.
